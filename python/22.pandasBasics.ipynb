       "  'body': 'This ensures that the builtin type `str` is also mapped to the future default string dtype (if `infer_string` is enabled), i.e. to make `.astype(str)` behave the same as `.astype(\\'str\")`.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general we rely on numpy for mapping builtin types to dtypes. For example `int` is mapped to `np.dtype(\"int64\")` by passing that value to `np.dtype(..)` in `pandas_dtype()`. \\r\\nBut now that we have a default dtype that is mapped to one of those builtin types, we can no longer rely on numpy doing that. Implementation wise, for `pandas_dtype(str)` I currently added a special case checking explicitly for `str` and then importing the dtype lazily and returning it. \\r\\n\\r\\nAn alternative could be to handle this through the ExtensionDtype `Registry.find()`. However, that currently relies on using `ExtensionDtype.construct_from_string()` (i.e. we would have to expand the typing there to allow type objects as well next to strings, which is of course also possible). And maybe it is better to have control centrally about builtin aliases, instead of allowing external dtypes to map to those as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nxref https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/54792/',\n",

       "  'body': \"This PR implements `StringDtype._get_common_dtype` to control the behaviour in concat etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis fixes two things:\\r\\n- When concatting with a numpy string-like dtype (S/U), we can preserve our StringDtype instead of converting to object dtype (as happens now). In general we don't store such numpy dtypes in pandas objects, but in certain corner cases we are passing numpy dtypes directly to `find_common_type`.\\r\\n- When concatting different instances of StringDtype. In practice this shouldn't happen often, but can certainly occur. In this case, I decided to give precedence to the pyarrow / pd.NA: 1) if pyarrow is installed, that's the default and therefore logical pick in this case as well, and 2) pd.NA is opt in, so if you have a mix, assume the user explicitly opted in and propagate that preference.\\r\\n\\r\\nxref https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/54792\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\n",

       "  'body': \"We have https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/56587 and https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/issues/59518 now for exporting pandas DataFrame and Series through the Arrow PyCapsule Interface (i.e. adding `__arrow_c_stream__` methods), but we don't yet have the import counterpart.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor importing, the [specification](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/dev/format/CDataInterface/PyCapsuleInterface.html#non-goals) doesn't provide any API guidelines on what this should look like, so we have a couple of options. The two main ones I can think of:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Add a dedicated `from_arrow()` method, which could be top level (`pd.from_arrow(..)`) or as class methods (`pd.DataFrame.from_arrow(..)`)\\r\\n- Support such objects directly in the main constructors (`pd.Dataframe(..)`)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn pandas itself, we do have a couple of `from_..` class methods (`from_dict`/`from_records`), but often for objects we also allow in the main constructor (at least for the dict case), but I think the main differentiator is that the specific class methods then have more specialized keyword arguments (and therefore allow a larger variety of input). \\r\\nSo based on that pattern, we could also do both: add a `DataFrame.from_arrow()` class method, and then also accept such objects in `pd.DataFrame()`, passing through to `from_arrow()` (which could have more custom options to control how the conversion from arrow to pandas exactly is done).\\r\\n\\r\\nLooking at polars, it seems they also have both, but I am not entirely sure about the connection between both. [`pl.from_arrow` ](https://docs.pola.rs/api/python/stable/reference/api/polars.from_arrow.html) already existed but might be more specific for pyarrow? And then https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/pull/17693 added it to the main `pl.DataFrame(..)` constructor (@kylebarron)\\r\\n\\r\\nFor geopandas, I added a `GeoDataFrame.from_arrow()` method.\\r\\n\\r\\n(to be clear, everything said above also applies to `Series()` / `Series.from_arrow()` etc)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\ncc @MarcoGorelli @WillAyd \",\n",

I.e. the resulting HTML will be\\r\\n\\r\\n`background-image: url(\\'data;`\\r\\n\\n\\n### Expected Behavior\\n\\nLet me input any valid CSS string. Remove validation / truncation since it is not compatible with valid CSS strings. \\n\\n### Installed Versions\\n\\n<details>\\r\\n\\r\\n/databricks/python/lib/python3.10/site-packages/_distutils_hack/__init__.py:33: UserWarning: Setuptools is replacing distutils.\\r\\n  warnings.warn(\"Setuptools is replacing distutils.\")\\r\\n\\r\\nINSTALLED VERSIONS\\r\\n------------------\\r\\ncommit                : d9cdd2ee5a58015ef6f4d15c7226110c9aab8140\\r\\npython                : 3.10.12.final.0\\r\\npython-bits           : 64\\r\\nOS                    : Linux\\r\\nOS-release            : 5.15.0-1067-azure\\r\\nVersion               : #76~20.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Thu Jun 13 18:00:23 UTC 2024\\r\\nmachine               : x86_64\\r\\nprocessor             : x86_64\\r\\nbyteorder             : little\\r\\nLC_ALL                : None\\r\\nLANG                  : C.UTF-8\\r\\nLOCALE                : en_US.UTF-8\\r\\n\\r\\npandas                : 2.2.2\\r\\nnumpy                 : 1.23.5\\r\\npytz                  : 2022.7\\r\\ndateutil              : 2.8.2\\r\\nsetuptools            : 65.6.3\\r\\npip                   : 22.3.1\\r\\nCython                : 0.29.32\\r\\npytest                : None\\r\\nhypothesis            : None\\r\\nsphinx                : None\\r\\nblosc                 : None\\r\\nfeather               : None\\r\\nxlsxwriter            : None\\r\\nlxml.etree            : 4.9.1\\r\\nhtml5lib              : None\\r\\npymysql               : None\\r\\npsycopg2              : None\\r\\njinja2                : 3.1.2\\r\\nIPython               : 8.14.0\\r\\npandas_datareader     : None\\r\\nadbc-driver-postgresql: None\\r\\nadbc-driver-sqlite    : None\\r\\nbs4                   : None\\r\\nbottleneck            : None\\r\\ndataframe-api-compat  : None\\r\\nfastparquet           : None\\r\\nfsspec                : None\\r\\ngcsfs                 : None\\r\\nmatplotlib            : 3.7.0\\r\\nnumba                 : None\\r\\nnumexpr               : None\\r\\nodfpy                 : None\\r\\nopenpyxl              : None\\r\\npandas_gbq            : None\\r\\npyarrow               : None\\r\\npyreadstat            : None\\r\\npython-calamine       : None\\r\\npyxlsb                : None\\r\\ns3fs                  : None\\r\\nscipy                 : 1.10.0\\r\\nsqlalchemy            : None\\r\\ntables                : None\\r\\ntabulate              : None\\r\\nxarray                : None\\r\\nxlrd                  : None\\r\\nzstandard             : None\\r\\ntzdata                : 2024.1\\r\\nqtpy                  : None\\r\\npyqt5                 : None\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n',\n",
